            I'm a Senior Software Engineer. Most recently I spent four and a half years at
            Afterpay/Cash App (Block), working on the web platform for Afterpay and Cash App. I enjoy building reliable systems and solving problems
            through thoughtful design.
          </p>

            I started my career in QA across utilities, retail, and consulting, and later
            transitioned into software engineering. That background shapes how I work
            today. I care deeply about reliability, quality, and observability. I build
            systems that hold up in production and instrument them with OpenTelemetry
            and Grafana so issues surface before users notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I like building AI-powered applications (RAG, LLM tooling)
            to automate workflows and reduce manual effort. I also enjoy hiking, going to
            the gym, and playing sports like badminton, table tennis, and tennis.
